    # Add depends_on here if you add external services (e.g., database)
    # networks: [appnet]  # Uncomment if you add more services and need a custom network

# No external services (databases, caches, etc.) detected in the project structure or Dockerfile.
# If you add a database or other service, add it here and configure networking/volumes as needed.

# No volumes section needed as there are no persistent data services.

# No custom networks defined as only one service is present.
